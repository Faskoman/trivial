## Trivial-Game

In order to have a question database, please:
* Copy everything from the questions.json 
* Insert them through the mongoDB for vscode playground and call the collection "questions"


Make a .env file with: "COOKIE_SECRET" , "PORT" & "MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING"

 the trivias build themselves from these questions.
